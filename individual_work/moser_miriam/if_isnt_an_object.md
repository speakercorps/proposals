# IF IS NOT AN OBJECT

Abstract (600 words): If/else statements do not belong in object-oriented programming. As a beginner, it can be difficult to think outside the if/else box. Let’s walk through some examples of how you can easily replace those ugly conditionals with polymorphism.

Details:
Many junior developers tends to rely on lengthy conditional statements when writing code because they are intuitive, though not object-oriented. I’ll provide a few approaches that make polymorphism approachable and understandable.

Pitch:
It can be difficult to break out of patterns you develop when you are first learning a language until you see a really concrete example of why those patterns should change. Conditionals are a favorite of beginners, and while many new devs may have heard that they aren’t a great idea in OO programs, they may not have seen any great examples of what they should do instead. I’ll give some clear examples of how to refactor your code so that conditionals are unnecessary.
