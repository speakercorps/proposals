## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS) were introduced by Netscape in 1996 as a competing specification to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Most recently, it was available in Netscape Communicator 4.0.

JavaScript Style Sheets allowed you to define custom styling rules for your web pages. JSSS allowed the developer to use the full weight of the language, including functions and conditionals to style the DOM.

In this talk, weâ€™ll review the history of JSSS, examples of JSSS from the past,  what it did better than CSS, what it did worse than CSS, what we can learn from JSSS, and using JSSS today.
