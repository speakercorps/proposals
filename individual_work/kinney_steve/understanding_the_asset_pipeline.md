# Understanding the Asset Pipeline

## Abstract

You probably use the Asset Pipeline everyday, but do you actually understand how it works and what it's doing? For many Rails developers, the Asset Pipeline is a black box smothered in secret sauce. In this session, we'll unwrap some of the mystery around how and why the Asset Pipeline does what it does.

## Details

In this talk, we'll cover the following topics:

* Understanding where Rails looks for client-side assets in your application
* Understanding how Rails treats files in the Asset Pipeline
* Viewing and modifying the Asset Pipeline load path
* Adding assets to manifests to create asset bundles
* Learning when not to use Asset Pipeline manifests
* Adding support for additional types of assets

The target audience is advanced beginner and intermediate Rails developers.

## Pitch

In my experience, many Rails developers possess only a cursory knowledge of the Asset Pipelineâ€”typically topping out at blindly typing `rake assets:precompile`. I've dug deep into the Asset Pipeline and come bearing the fruits of my knowledge to share with the larger Rails community.

I've taught a number of classes on the Asset Pipeline to beginner and intermediate Rails developers and know what the common questions and points of confusion are and I'll be able to bring that into this talk.
