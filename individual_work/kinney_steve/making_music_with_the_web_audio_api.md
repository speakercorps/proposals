## The story you'd like to tell

If you'll have me, I'd like to talk about using the Web Audio API to create musical instruments in the browser. Ideally, I'd do a quick review of what the API is and has to offer, show a few existing examples of it being used, and then branch off into potentially cool uses like combining the Web Audio API with WebSockets to create collaborative music in the browser or combining sound and visualization in the browser.
