# Building a Web Application with Ember and Rails

## Abstract

What if your web application was just another client for your API? In this lab, we'll build an Ember application as well as an API in Rails and get them working together. We'll use Ember CLI to build our client-side application and Ember Data to connect with our API.

## Details

In this lab, we'll build a clone of the notes application in iOS and OS X from the ground upâ€”complete with the a live-updating list of notes on the side and Markdown support.

We'll start by scaffolding our Ember application with `http-mocks` and AJAX requests. Next, we'll hook up Ember Data to abstract our server interaction.

Then, we'll switch gears to the Rails side of the equation, where we'll build and test an API.

We'll tie everything together and get our Ember application to talk to our Rails API.

Finally, we'll integrate support for rendering Markdown on our notes live in the browser.

This lab session would run three hours.

## Pitch

I've taught this session three times before to Rails developers with little to no JavaScript experience.

As JavaScript's popularity grows, many Rails developers are starting to get interested in building rich experiences on the client-side, but it's a bit overwhelming to figure out where to begin. This lab will give them a chance to build something from scratch and see how all of the pieces fit together. We'll cover some common patterns that participants will be able to apply in the future.
