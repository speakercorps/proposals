# Using JavaScript from the Future in Your Rails App Today

## Abstract

ECMAScript 6 has a metric ton of new Ruby-friendly features that make working with JavaScript less painfulâ€”including but not limited to: classes, implicitly returning functions, string interpolation, and modules. We'll  In this session, we'll take a look at how you can use these features today in your Rails applications.

## Details

This is a talk for Rails developers who are curious about using some of the features they know and love from Ruby in JavaScript.

First, I'll introduce ES6 and talk a little bit about existing and future browser support. (5 minutes)

Then we will get Rails wired up to support a collection of polyfills that will add ES6 support to our application. (5 minutes)

Next we'll discuss some of the new features in ES6 and how to use them (30 minutes):

* Classes
* Fat-arrow functions
* String interpolation
* Module loading (as an alternative to concatenating files with the Asset Pipeline)
* Array comprehensions

## Pitch

I spend my days teaching JavaScript to Rails developers, so this is something I'm incredibly passionate about. Most Ruby developers have to deal with JavaScript when building applications in Rails. This session will allow them to work more effectively by showing that they can bring some of the best parts of Ruby to their front-end development.
