##Abstract
What is Faraday? How and why should you use it in your applications? We'll take a deeper look at what an HTTP library really does and what it means to use to use an API wrapper.

##Details
Faraday can wrap multiple adapters rather than just one, like many other wrappers. We use it to perform to HTTP requests rather than just respond to them. We will look at the code necessary to properly use this middleware device along with the simple and more complex ways in which to use it.

We'll review some common API/HTTP terms that may not be understood by newer developers:
- Middleware - what it is and when to use it.
- API Wrappers - how these are different from an API itself.
- HTTP Library - what is involved in one.

After the session, attendees will have an understanding of what Faraday is, how to use it, and the ease of use.

##Pitch
After finding the best wrappers to use and playing with many in several projects, I began to see that Faraday was performing top-notch. I've explored the Faraday docs to discover the ins and outs of the gem and how it works. In this session I hope to shed some light on the importance of using the Faraday middleware as well as the ease of use that actually comes with it. I hope to alleviate the fear of APIs and wrappers that many new users may have.
