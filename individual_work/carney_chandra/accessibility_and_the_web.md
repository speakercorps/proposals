##How to Program with Accessibility in Mind

##Abstract
What does accessibility entail as it is related to the web? Most developers don't consider that someone with visual impairments may use the web and don't think about what this experience may be like for someone who has a visual impairment. The current trend is to push access-driven design to the end of feature building, but we will explore why this needs to be a top priority.

##Details
The audience for this talk will be developers with all levels of experience. We will explore how screen readers are used and how to create good front-facing code that will provide a smooth usability experience. I will demonstrate a few accessible and a few inaccessible sites and show the code surrounding both.

Items covered will include:
* An explanation of web accessibility
* A look at how someone with a visual impairment uses the web
* Accessible code vs. inaccessible code: what the differences look like
* Why programming with accessibility in mind is not used widely
* Who currently programs using accessibility tactics
* How we as developers can start making our code more accessible

Attendees will be able to take away easy, effective steps and best practices that they can begin to utilize in their web applications.

##Pitch
My mother is a developer. She is also blind. Growing up with her gave me a different perception of technology and how it can influence someone's life on a large scale - watching technological advancement over the years made me more aware of good and bad decisions early on in the technology industry. Seeing her interact with technology and program in languages like Fortran, Cobol, and Focus was inspiring. But now with simple tools in place for making a readily accessible web, the lack of attention to this matter seems careless. Now as a developer myself, I see how easy these steps are to take, yet how little used these methods are. I hope to increase awareness and inspire people to use these simple tools to make a more accessible web.
