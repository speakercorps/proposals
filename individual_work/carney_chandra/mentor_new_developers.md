##Abstract
Let's look at examples from Kathy Kram and other research on how mentor relationships can apply to and be used in the community of developers. Many of us would love to give back and help out those just getting started on the web—but, how can we best help? Which strategies work and which don't despite our best intentions? In this session, we'll talk to aspiring Ruby developers and their mentors to hear what they get the most benefit from when working together.

##Details
The intended audience takeaway is that each group (mentors and students) has a better understanding of what they can do to support a mentoring relationship.

We’ll use research from scholar Kathy Kram and historical examples of mentor pairs (think: Larry Page or Marissa Mayer) to get to the bottom of what makes a successful pair tick. Finally, we’ll share some of our experience in putting this research into action so that you may join us in discovering what it takes to cultivate a meaningful mentorship.

We'll also try to answer the following questions:

* What do mentors say they wish their students would do?
* What are students looking for from their mentors?
* What patterns consistently work and how can they be replicated in a mentor/student relationship?
The goal of the this session is to attempt to build a bridge between these two groups' mutual interests. We'll conduct interviews and surveys as part of the preparation for the presentation.

Creating a culture of mentoring and learning will allow us to ensure that the next generation of junior developers (and those after that) are the types of people that we all want to work with: curious, hungry for knowledge, and successful at communicating with others.

##Pitch
We are students and mentors working to explore what makes a successful mentor relationship and improve upon that. We've found the best ways to implement a pairing schedule that helps and works with both parties' interests.

Instructors are often caught between mentors who want to assist students but aren't quite sure how to help out and students who don't know how to make the best use of their mentors. This seems like a solvable problem, but it's actually quite nuanced.

We hope that the audience walks away understanding that they can be the positive change and influence in mentor relationships and that they also see the underdeveloped network of mentors. We want to show that we all have an impact in the ability to turn mentoring from a wishful yearly resolution into a reality. Mentor relationships are an indispensable part of any developer’s career and allow for experiential knowledge transfer.
