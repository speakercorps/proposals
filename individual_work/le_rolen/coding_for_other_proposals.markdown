Lingua Franca:  The Communication, Style, and Empathy of Code

## Abstract

Ruby is a programming *language*. As developers, we tend to think of ourselves as craftsman  or artists with a focus on eloquence and style, writing programs that tell stories. We aspire to be Ruby’s Hemingway or Shakespeare, aiming to create beautiful code. This belief can lead us astray. Favoring clever over concise. We should be coding like journalists in the manner of  Walter Cronkite or Tom Brokaw. We should be creating code that is digestible and actionable, not beautiful and thought provoking.

## Details

Through the allegory of long form literature and short form journalism, I will identify code smells of what unconcise code looks like and how to make code tell better stories. I will address that sometimes that methods that seem “ugly” can be the most concise. I will emphasize that developers skills sets are diverse with different levels understanding and organizations should having a style guide of how code should be written that everyone can understand.

## Pitch

As a junior developer,  I sometimes struggle with understanding how other peoples code work, taking several minutes to comprehend what is going on. By making a focus on how readable the code is, it will help lower the barrier of entry solving problems for my organization.
