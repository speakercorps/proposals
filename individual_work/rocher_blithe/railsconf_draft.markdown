### Title

I18n Means Better Software

### Abstract

_What is your talk about? (500 characters or less)_

Many experienced Rails developers have never internationalized a Rails application. But it's a useful and marketable skill that even a novice developer can learn. 

Much like testing, internationalization (i18n) of a Rails application shouldn’t be an afterthought. The process of internationalization can help save time and simplify a codebase, even if the application is only deployed in one language.

In this session we’ll cover the process of internationalizing a Rails application, a handful of the most useful gems and services, and look at how the process improves the codebase.

### Details

_Explain the theme and flow of your talk. What are the intended audience takeaways?_
_Include any pertinent details such as outlines, outcomes or intended audience._

This talk will introduce beginning Rails developers to the process of internationalizing and localizing a Rails application. It covers:

* important definitions
* why internationalization can be useful (even for a beginner)
* an overview of how to implement i18n in a Rails application
* tips for using locale files in views, forms, and tests
* tips for using locale files for non-standard strings like dates, currency, ActiveRecord errors
* tips for internationalizing user generated content
* useful gems and services for adding translations for additional languages

### Pitch

_Only visible by review committee._
_Why is this talk pertinent? What is your involvement in the topic?_
_Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic._

I have internationalized and localized a Rails application for a client based outside of the United States. I learned that the process not as intimidating as it seems. I also learned a few things that would have been helpful to know before I started the project.

Internationalization and localization are topics that a beginning Rails developer is capable of understanding and implementing. It's also a skill that would be helpful to learn as a beginner instead of later in a developer's career.

Though new to the developer community, I've been speaking and teaching for the past ten years. I also co-organize a monthly meetup for women interested in learning about Ruby on Rails.
