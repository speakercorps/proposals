### Title

The Scientific Method of Troubleshooting

### Description

_This will be posted on the website and in the program. It should be about a paragraph long. If it's too long or too short we can fix it after your talk is accepted._

For software engineers, troubleshooting is one of the toughest and most important skills to develop. When problems arise, a beginning developer's first instincts are to panic and head to StackOverflow. Rather than rushing to deploy quick fixes, it's important to identify the root cause.

Biologists, chemists, and physicists increase understanding about the world by applying the logical steps of the scientific method to discover solutions to complex problems. Like scientists, developers can learn troubleshooting skills by treating each problem like a mini "science" experiment.

In this talk we'll explore how using the scientific method can lead to greater understanding and more viable solutions to complex problems.


### Why are you or your talk a great fit for Madison+ Ruby Conference?

_This is bonus space to explain your awesomeness to us in detail. If you run out of space please use the back of this form._
I have a PhD in physical chemistry but recently changed careers to become a web developer. Though new to the developer community, I've been speaking and teaching for the past ten years. I've coached at several RailsGirls and RailsBridge events and I co-organize a monthly meetup for women interested in learning about Ruby on Rails.

Because Madison+ Ruby is such a beginner-friendly conference, this beginner-focused talk will fit right in. It intends to provide beginning developers with knowledge about a technical skill without being intimidating. 

This talk is also a fit for Madison+ Ruby's excellent mix of technical and eclectic topics. It should be a nice blend of the technical aspects of troubleshooting with the practical skills I've learned in the chemistry lab.


### Intended Audience?

_Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Porpoises_

Beginner


### Has this talk been given elsewhere? (If so, where?)

_This does not at all preclude us from accepting your talk. If there is a strong reason it should be repeated let us know! (Tiger gave the same talk at 4 conferences last year, it happens)_

This talk has not been given anywhere else.
